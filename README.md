## React + TS + ESlint + Prettier initial template

This repo is a basic pre-built React app with Typescript configured with eslint, Prettier and best pratices of airbnb.

This project was created following the instructions of this [Blog](https://andrebnassis.medium.com/setting-eslint-on-a-react-typescript-project-2021-1190a43ffba).

This other [Blog](https://brygrill.medium.com/create-react-app-with-typescript-eslint-prettier-and-github-actions-f3ce6a571c97) was helpful.

##### Bolerplate overview:

- React: [Front end library](https://es.reactjs.org/).
- Typescript: [Programming language](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- ESlint: [Linter](https://eslint.org/).
- Prettier: [Formater](https://prettier.io/).
- Airbnb Rules: [Plugin](https://yarnpkg.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb).
- Yarn: [Node package manager](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/).

#### Reason for existence of this repository

Those of us who have been working with React for a long time know that Typescript is a better option.

To ensure that the code written is of high quality, ESlint is installed to highlight style errors in the code of the .css, .ts and .tsx files mainly. Prettier for formatting styles and airbnb plugin which is one of the most popular rules plugin in the industry these days.

#### Considerations

##### ESlint Rules

The rules that I have set, was given by my own criteria or by my preference, but feel free to modify them to put the ones that best suit your projects.

I recommend this [documentation](https://typescript-eslint.io/) about Typescript and ESlint rules.

##### Prettier
Like the ESLint rules, these also can also be modified to your preference.
See for [options](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html) in here.

#### Disclaimers
